# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis
  The purpose of this analysis is to create a summary of the PyBer ride-sharing data. The summary will be based on City Type (Urban, Suburban and Rural). The data includes total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and average fare per driver. This analysis also includes a multiple line graph, it shows total weekly fares for each city type.
## Results
Below is a table that shows the results of the summary. In the table we can see that there is a significant difference between the rural city data and the urban city data.

- The areas of difference include total rides with there being 1500 more rides in the urban city types then rural city types.
- In the total driver’s column, we can see there is about 2300 more drivers in Urban city types then Rural city types.
- In the total fares’ column, there is about a $35,000 difference. The urban city types had around $39,000 and the rural city types have around $4,300.
- In the average fare per driver column, we see $39 difference, with the dollar amount larger for the rural city types.
- However, there is only about a $10 difference in the average fare per ride column between the two city types. Whereas there is a smaller difference between the suburban and urban data.

The results also show there is about a $4.50 difference between both rural and suburban city types and suburban and urban city types. 

The line chart below show the differences between the city types with fares per week between Jan 01, 2019 and April 29, 2019.

## Summary
  Here are three recommendations based on the results of the PyBer dataframe and how to fix the disparities between the different city types. 

### Recommendation 1
 Based on the results we gathered, we can see there is a larger proportion of fares happening in the urban areas then the rural areas, but we are also seeing larger fares per ride and larger fare per driver in rural areas. This could mean that even though the rural drivers have an average of 1.6 rides each they are going a longer distance and as a result the have a larger fare per ride. My first recommendation based on this data is to have incentives for both riders and drivers. An incentive to have the rural communities use the ride-share app more for example would be, ride 10 times and get a discounted 11th ride. An example incentive for the drivers would be maybe a discount for gas. So there are more drivers on the road with a paying ride.
 
 ### Recommendation 2
 The data also shows a large number of drivers in the urban city types but there is not a proportionate number of total rides. Meaning not every driver in the urban areas have had a paying ride. My second recommendation is to remove the drivers that have not had a paying ride in the past 60 days off the ride sharing app. This would give the drivers who do having paying rides more opportunities to get more paying customers. 
 
 ### Recommendation 3
 My final recommendation would be to charge a higher fare in the urban and suburban areas. We can see that even though they have a larger number of total rides the average fare per ride and average fare per driver is smaller than the rural city type averages. I believe that in rural city types, they are traveling for a longer distance, which could be why there is a higher average fare per ride/average fare per driver. In the urban city types, they could be traveling for a shorter distance. Which means for the rider the shorter distance you go, the more economically friendly the ride-share app. The best way to see if this is true would be to do more research in PyBer to get data on what the fare is per distance.
